<p>An experimental design as in horticulture in which different treatments are distributed in random order in a block or plot called also randomized block design. In the statistical theory of the design of experiments blocking is the arranging of experimental units in groups blocks that are similar to one another. Instead blocking is a strategy for grouping people in your data analysis in order to reduce noise it is an analysis strategy.</p>
