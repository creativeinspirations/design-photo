<p>Biomimicry enables architects to make positive impact on the environment says Michael Pawlyn. The bio-enhancing admix and three dimensional designs of ECOncretes products induce a layer of biogenic buildup that makes the concrete stronger and more durable through bioprotection which is perfect for creating structures like seawalls breakwaters bridge foundations and urban waterfronts. Oakey posits that the next frontier in biomimetic carpet design will be 3-D printing which will allow designers to create carpet tiles at the site echoing natures way of existing in a local context. This article explores the ways in which biomimicry techniques based on the Design Spiral and Janine Benyus Biomimicry Design Lens Principles of Life can be combined with the design process of an interior design thereby to create a framework with the help of which a designer works and creates a sustainable interior design.
