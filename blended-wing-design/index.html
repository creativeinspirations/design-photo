<p>This configuration incorporates design features from conventional fuselage as well as traditional flying wing. The benefits of the blended wing design are traditionally tied to efficiency from weight loss. Blended Wing Body or Hybrid Wing Body aircraft display a flattened and airfoil shaped body due to the blending of the wing and body at the wing root reducing the traditional step fond between these.
