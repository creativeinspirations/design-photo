Bioreactors are essential in tissue engineering not only because they provide an in vitro environment mimicking in vivo conditions for the growth of tissue substitutes but also because they enable systematic studies of the responses of living tissues to various mechanical and biochemical cues. These devices are being developed for use in tissue engineering or biochemicalbioprocess engineering. Catalogue record for this book is available from the Library of Congress.

<p>In this expert handbook both the topics and contributors are selected so as to provide an authoritative view of possible applications for this new technology. For the first time in a single volume the design characterisation and operation of the bioreactor system in which the tissue is grown is detailed. Bioreactors are essential in tissue engineering not only because they provide an in vitro environment mimicking in vivo conditions for the growth of tissue substitutes but also because they enable systematic studies of the responses of living tissues to various mechanical and biochemical cues. Bioreactors for Tissue Engineering presents an overall picture of the current state of knowledge in the engineering of bioreactors for several tissue types bone cartilage vascular addresses the issue of mechanical conditioning of the tissue and describes the use of techniques such as MRI for monitoring tissue growth.
