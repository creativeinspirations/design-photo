<p>By considering the itemsets and itemsets are arranged in the form of binary search tree. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the nodes key. Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties.</p>

Can be used to build Dictionaries. It focus on how to reduce the cost of the search of the BST It focus on how to reduce the cost of the search of the BST. Due to this on average operations in binary search tree take only Olog n time. As we saw in Section 44 the number of comparisons made by binary search in the worst case C worst bs n is given by the formula. If rootvalue key return true.</p>

Let us consider the 1 - itemsets I1 as 2 I2 as 3 I3 as 4 I4 as 1 I5 as 6 and I6 as 2 occurrences. The principal algorithm for this problem is binary search. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search. A binary search tree BST also called an ordered binary tree is a type of binary tree where the nodes are arranged in order.
