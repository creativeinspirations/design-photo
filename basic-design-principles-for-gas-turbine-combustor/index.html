<p>The basic geometry of a combustion chamber is largely dictated by the need to achieve efficient combustion with the minimum of pressure loss and at overall mixture strengths that lie well outside the inflammability limits of kerosine air mixtures. The gas turbine operates on an open cycle consisting of a compressor a combustor and a turbine combined in series Figure 2. The basic principle on which the gas turbine works is identical to all the engines which is used to extract energy from the chemical fuel. In both the cases air is made to enter the prime mover which compresses air and it is heated by the combustion process and thus raising the pressure still further expanded and finally the expanded products are discharged through the exhaust. A combustor is a component or area of engine where combustion takes place. Gas Turbine Power Plants.</p>
