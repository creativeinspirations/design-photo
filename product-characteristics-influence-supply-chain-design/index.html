<p><strong>Product Characteristics Influence Supply Chain Design</strong>, An important component in supply chain design is determining how an effective supply chain design is achieved given a performance measure or a set of performance measures. When changes in operations require it such as the digitization of processes or the reconfiguration of the supply network.

<p>Dont let your business suffer because you failed to take supply chain design into account. Product design for supply chain management means building products that thrive in and enhance your supply chain architecture. Have compared simultaneous design with sequential design and found that a gain of 125 can be expected when the product family and the supply chain are optimized together.</p>
<h3 id="higher-complexity-in-product-demand-and-design-characteristics-increases-complexity-in-supply-chain-coordination-and-configuration-while-reducing-complexity-in-supply-chain-collaboration">Higher complexity in product demand and design characteristics increases complexity in supply chain coordination and configuration while reducing complexity in supply chain collaboration.</h3><p>This article investigates supply chain strategies and empirically tests the supply chain strategy model that posits lean agile and leanagile approaches using data collected from 604 manufacturing firms in China. A product might be attractive for customers but drive unnecessary supply chain costs because of the impact the product design has on sourcing packaging production warehousing and transportation. Accordingly your business needs to be able to adjust to the needs of your customers. Higher complexity in product demand and design characteristics increases complexity in supply chain coordination and configuration while reducing complexity in supply chain collaboration. These authors show that decisions on product design have a major impact on supply chain design and vice-versa.
