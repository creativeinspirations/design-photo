<p>The first base-isolated building with over 60 m height in Japan and Thousand Tower was the tallest base-isolated residential Tower in Japan when completed. The first is design of base isolation device and the second is design of structural elements above the isolation layer. Basic design procedures are presented including determination of design earthquake forces modelling of base-isolation layers modelling of the superstructure selection of ground motions time-history analyses and performance criteria. The paper is aiming towards design of different types of base isolators namely Lead Rubber Bearing LRB High Damping Rubber bearing HDR and Friction Pendulum System FPS. When Base Isolation in a seismic Structural Design of earthquake occurs the ground moves laterally and damages the structure.

<p>With the base isolation system it is possible for the high-rise buildings to possess not only the high seismic performance but also the flexible planning in the design using high. The idea that a building can be uncoupled from the damaging effects of the ground movement produced by a strong earthquake has appealed to inventors and engineers for more than a century. A mandated peer-review system unique for design of base-isolated structures is also noted. Many ingenious devices have been proposed to achieve this result but very few have been implemented and the concept now referred to as base isolation. Isolation provides an excellent substitute for fixed base design where earthquakes are frequent.

<p>QuakeSafe Technologies have recently completed the worlds largest single supply of base isolation bearings for a project. The main content of base isolation structure design consists of two parts. This paper describes recent implementations of base isolation and describes an approximate linear theory of isolation which can be used for the design of base isolation systems that use multilayer elastomeric isolators. BASE ISOLATION DESIGN FOR CIVIL COMPONENTS AND CIVIL STRUCTURES F. After an event of earthquake the repair of structure and loss of non-structural components may be a more costly affair than installing base.
