<p>These intake facilities are relatively simple to build and the seawater they collect is pretreated via slow filtration through the subsurface sandseabed formations in the area of source water extraction. Other types of well intake systems include slant wells horizontal wells and radial collector wells Ranney wells. A sea water intake system has to be designed and constructed to ensure sufficient sea water in terms of quantity and quality.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-case-of-sea-water-the-wells-are-located-close-to-the-beach">In the case of sea water the wells are located close to the beach.</h3><p>Well screens or larger. Designing of intake structures The following points must be considered while designing and locating the intake structures. Perforated pipes are arranged in a radial pattern in the sand onshore below the water level. This capacity of 16000 m 3 per km 2 might be useful for a medium-size reverse osmosis plant like the MED plant currently operating in Dukhan Township and they can be used to artificially recharging the aquifer. Intake in addition to the existing groundwater wells which will remain in operation after the WTP has been commissioned. Beach wells are recommended when seawater quality can vary over the season andor when high turbidity peaks can occur.</p>
