<p>-300F to 450F -184C to 232C O-Ring dependent. Can be used with steam air gas water and vapor lines with high flow velocities can be installed in lines with vertical flow available with renewable seat rings. The ball rotates with the valve stem to achieve the opening and closing action.</p>

Depending on the valve and trim we can achieve temperatures in excess of 1000F for metal seated ball valves. Ball Checks Ball check valves use a ball inside the body to control the movement of flow. A floating design ball valve sandwiches the hollow ball between two or more cupped seats that form a tight seal between the body and the ball at the inlet and outlet ports of the valve body. A Ball Check Valve is a simple and reliable valve with the only moving part to block the reverse flow is a spherical ball. This feature makes ball checks useful for viscous media.</p>

<p>The diameter of the through hole is determined by the required flow rate which is in turn dictated by the Reynolds number the fluid pressure and the Kinematic viscosity of the solution or gas. Designing a ball check valve starts with the diameter of the through hole. The ball-lift check valves are used in highly viscous fluid service. Note in Figure 1 the dimension H1 which is to be used if the ball is spring loaded. The metal-seated specialty-coated ball closes tightly against a set of precision coated and lapped seats providing zero-leakage if the hardened seating surfaces are not scratched by debris in the line.

<p>Ball valve is mainly constructed of valve body seat ball valve stem handle or other driving device. Consult Factory or Distributor for more help. However like all other valves ball valves are generally rated at a lower pressure for steam service than for liquid or dry gaseous service. Combination of SPE and DPE A trunnion mounted ball valve with the upstream seat unidirectional and the downstream seat bi-directional blocks the fluid at the downstream seat in both directions while it blocks the fluid on the upstream seat in one direction only.

Ball valve design in which the ball is not rigidly held on its rotational axis is free to float between the seat rings. AVK ball check valves are self-cleaning as the ball rotates during operation which eliminates the risk of impurities getting stuck on the ball.

Ball Checks Ball check valves use a ball inside the body to control the movement of flow. A double-disc or wafer check valve consists of two half-circle disks hinged together. In the closed position ball is pushed against the seat by the pressure of the fluid from upstream and hence can pressure seal the downstream of.

<p>A Ball Check Valve is a simple and reliable valve with the only moving part to block the reverse flow is a spherical ball. Designing a ball check valve starts with the diameter of the through hole. A Ball Check Valve is a simple and reliable valve with the only moving part to block the reverse flow is a spherical ball. A Ball Check Valve consists of a threaded or flanged body with internal features that guide a rubbercoated ball in and out of the seat as the flow goes forward and reverse. Can be used with steam air gas water and vapor lines with high flow velocities can be installed in lines with vertical flow available with renewable seat rings.

<p>Kepners Flexible Seal Seat design combines metal-to-metal contact with a resilient seal seat to ensure bubble-tight shutoff of liquid or gas and long service life. The ball is rotated usually 90 degrees by a shaft that protrudes outside of the valve body and is connected to some form of operator. A ball check valve is a type of check valve in which the movable part is a spherical ball as illustrated in Figure 413. Check valves for lubricators are usually mounted upside down so use a spring to keep the ball against the seat. The two disks fold together upon positive flow and retract to a full.

<p>AVK ball check valves are self-cleaning as the ball rotates during operation which eliminates the risk of impurities getting stuck on the ball. An important dimension in a check valve is the distance the ball rises out of its seat. The ball rotates with the valve stem to achieve the opening and closing action. The standard ball is designed with a NBR rubber lined metal core and the rubber hardness is optimized to prevent the ball from getting stuck in the seat. Ball valve design in which the ball is not rigidly held on its rotational axis is free to float between the seat rings.
