<p>R LD 6. The primary objective in a batch distillation is to minimize both the batch cycle time and heat input by optimizing the number of stages and reflux ratio to achieve the required separation. Due to the dynamic behavior of the operation of batch distillation that leads to more difficult operation such efforts have been done to attain the desired specifications and at the same time to increase the operability. This paper considers for the first time the simultaneous multi-objective optimisation of design and operation of batch distillation as well as of batch hybrid distillationpervaporation processes. However the design of a batch distillation system is more complicated because of the transient nature of the operation and because there may be several ways in which the overall separations required may be accomplished.
