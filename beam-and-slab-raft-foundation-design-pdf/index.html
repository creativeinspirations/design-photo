<p>Mat Foundation Raft Foundation It is a combined footing that may cover the entire area under a structure supporting several columns and walls. The ground must be well consolidated and capable of supporting a load of at least 50kNm². Typically it consists of an 85mm thick slab supported by a grid of ribs normally 100mm wide at 1200mm x 1200mm centres.</p>
<h3 id="the-inner-diameter-of-the-annulus-is-8m">The inner diameter of the annulus is 8m.</h3><p>Foundation design for an earthquake resistance is one of the most important parts to be considered in the structural analysis and design. The ground must be well consolidated and capable of supporting a load of at least 50kNm². The inner diameter of the annulus is 8m. All columns are 230 x 450mm the grade of concrete f ck is 30 Nmm 2 and the yield strength of the reinforcement f yk is 500 Nmm 2. The properties used in the analysis and the design of this raft foundation are shown in table 4. That the depth of raft foundation is much larger than those of other types of shallow foundations.</p>
