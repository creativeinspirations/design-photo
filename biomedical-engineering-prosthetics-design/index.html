<p>A systematic review of. Engineers can learn from past design mistakes and strive to create new prostheses that dont face the same problems. From research in the lab to engineering at the work bench to patient-use the hospital bedside biomedical engineers are responsible for technologies like medical X-ray imaging MRI PET scans artificial hearts advanced prosthetic limbs artificial hip implants prenatal ultrasound and arthroscopic surgery to name a few. This course has five design projects the highlight of which is dubbed the roller coaster experiment.
