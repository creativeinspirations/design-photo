Biomimetics also known as biomimicry is a field of study in which scientists examine nature and borrow elements of design to create new technologies or products. The simplest explanation is that Biomimicry is design inspired by Nature. Biomimicry - or biomimetics - is the examination of nature its systems its procedures processes and elements to then take inspiration for new inventions that help humans solve problems in which they are.
