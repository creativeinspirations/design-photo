<p>It is a must-have for sports field managers ground crew members architects field builders athletic directors sports turf management students league volunteers and board members. I wanted to make foul poles last year but didnt know exactly what to do and so I come to rbaseball for help. In 1958 MLB had passed a rule stipulating that no future ballpark could have a distance to the foul pole of less than 325 feet. Yankee Stadium and others had been grandfathered in but Finleys plan was dead in the water. The best-looking foul pole for your field might not be ideal for the next baseball diamond and so on.
