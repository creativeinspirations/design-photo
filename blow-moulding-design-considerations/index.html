<p>Plastic blow molding has a bit more freedom in design between each mold half shape. Locate the parting line of the mold in the part. The blow molding process allows for complex hollow parts with tight tolerances to be produced at a lower cost and with faster cycle times than other molding methods such as rotomolding. In this process air pressure is applied inside the mould to achieve the desired shape. The parison is then heated and stretched downward by the core.
