To figure the revolutions of the engine per mile it helps to know that 60 mph is one mile per minute so the engines rpm at 60 mph is actually the revolutions of the engine per mile traveled. The engine works by using heat. In early steam engines the spent steam was vented to the air the piston retracted and the cycle began again modern steam engines work slightly differently. If you watch the video below you will see that the cylinder on this engine actually moves back and forth as the flywheel turns it oscillates this action is what opens and closes the ports which let compressed air enter the engine and exhaust air leave.
