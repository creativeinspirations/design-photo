<p>The batch reactor is often a good reactor archetype for slow reactions. Sequencing batch reactor design criteria performance costs. Semi-batch reactors operate much like batch reactors in that they take place in a single stirred tank with similar equipment. In this module several ideal types of reactors are discussed based on two modes of operation batch and continuous and ideal flow patterns back-mix and tubular for the continuous mode. Batch reactors are normally used in small-scale laboratory set-ups to study the kinetics of chemical reactions. Reactor Design General Principles Sciencedirect.</p>
