<p>I am not a fan of subject centered curriculum in general but realize it is very necessary in modern US education. The discipline design model of curriculum is often used. In higher education competing demands for accountability and innovation in the face of globalization technology and budget cuts cause us to consider how best to prepare learners who will learn for a lifetime. Higher student achievement through the use of repetition and making critical connects to content as well as increased student engagement are all benefits of an integrated curriculum. Highlight work changes as well as lack of promotions or changes of responsibility.

<p>My subject matters have content that complement each other. Highlight work changes as well as lack of promotions or changes of responsibility. These insights can be challenging to glean in a largely online learning environment. Students in history should learn the subject matter like historians students in biology should learn how biologist learn and so with students in mathematics should learn how mathematicians learn. Communicate in new ways with stakeholders to facilitate discussion and collaboration.
