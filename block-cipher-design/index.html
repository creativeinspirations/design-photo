<p><strong>Block Cipher Design</strong>, 3 How Block Ciphers are Designed As explained above the rst requirement we impose on the construction is that it generates key streams without exploitable linear correlations. A block cipher by itself is only suitable for the secure cryptographic transformation of one fixed-length group of bits called a block. A mode of operation describes how to repeatedly apply a ciphers single-block operation.</p>

Modern block ciphers typically use a block length of 128 bits or more Examples of block ciphers include DES AES RC6 and IDEA A block cipher breaks message into fixed sized blocks Takes one block plaintext at a time and transform it into another block of. A block cipher takes a block of plaintext bits and generates a block of ciphertext bits generally of same size. In cryptography a block cipher mode of operation is an algorithm that uses a block cipher to provide information security such as confidentiality or authenticity. First several block cipher constructions are analyzed mathematically using statistical cryptanalysis.
