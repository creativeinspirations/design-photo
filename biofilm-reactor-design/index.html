<p>It was commercialized by Kaldnes Miljöteknologi now called AnoxKaldnes and owned by Veolia Water TechnologiesThere are over 700 wastewater treatment systems both. Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor Technology. This technology was developed. The original design of the biofilm reactor was based on pilot studies conducted over several years and an empirical model was developed to predict the biofilm reactor performance. However with the right procedure to follow you do not need an expert to help you in the design process of the MBBR.

<p>FBBRs have been applied successfully to small wastewater treatment plants where complete nitrification but no high degree of denitrification is necessary. Culties associated with reaching a uniform distribution of biofilm on the support surface are among the drawbacks of aerated submerged fixed-bed biofilm reactors RUSTEN et al.

The moving bed biofilm reactor MBBR can operate as a 2- anoxic or 3-aerobic phase system with buoyant free-moving plastic bioftlm carriers. The TAN removal rates of MBBRs for a freshwater Atlantic salmon Salmo salar smolt plant and a brown trout and arctic char juveniles plant were 0405 and 03 g NH 4 m 2 day respectively 44.
