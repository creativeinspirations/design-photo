<p>Build this bat house 23. Bat loft and squeeze box. However a bat barn requires careful design and because of its size may also need planning permission before it can be constructed. Horseshoe bats need a larger access so that they can fly instead of crawl directly into the roost. The places that bats choose to roost.

<p>RammSanderson holds considerable expertise in the area of bat ecology licencing and mitigation. Create new loft elsewhere in building or in existing building on site good chance of success. As above the roosting area should not be trussed cluttered to allow flight. You might even need to insulate the roost in order to minimise temperature fluctuations. Bats had to negotiate a 90º turn to enter the service trench at the point shaded blue and again at the base of the chute.
