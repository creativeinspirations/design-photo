<p>After our series of interviews and analysis of existing resources we divided the challenges of the bio-inspired design process into four stages. Following the specific steps within each phase helps ensure the successful integration of lifes strategies into human designs. Without this relevant knowledge it may be difficult for any designer to create a viable solution adapted from nature. By comparing our design goals with natures functions and putting them into context we can start tapping into 38 billion years of natures strategy catalog.

<p>We present in details the various design stages for both design directions. There are three types of biomimicry - one is copying form and shape another is copying a process like photosynthesis in a leaf and the third is mimicking at an ecosystems level like building a nature-inspired city. In order to guide the designer through the natures design process Carl Hastrich designed a new method for the.

<p>The unique challenges of the biomimicry design process can be divided into four phases. Ecosystem principles listed can be applied to the design process by transforming them into a set of questions that are asked of the project at each stage of the design Biomimicry Guild 2007 Charest 2007. The Biomimicry Design Spiral was developed in 2005 by Carl Hastrich an industrial designer who was one of a cluster of devoted individuals that we can thank for building the foundations for biomimicry as we know it today. A detailed understanding of biology is often needed for biomimicry research and design. We mainly elaborate on the three core stages.
