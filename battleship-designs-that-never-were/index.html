<p>One less turret more efficient compartmentalization. Four Battleships that were never built but could have been. My design for converting a Hood class hull into an aircraft carrier. The North Carolina South Dakota and Iowa-class battleships all involved design compromises. Whereas the Vesa was a warship that proved too large when she was actually built the Maximum Battleship design was a project meant to be so big it was bound to fail.

Benjamin Tillman D-SC took office in 1895 and he quickly opposed the expansion of the US. See my essay the Post Treaty Battleships Part 1 for a discussion of Vanguard They were designed for a new pattern 16in triple gun mount that ultimately was never produced. Unified armament of 12 x 10 guns in six twin turrets. The Lion class was mostly limited by shipyards and docking facilities overseas though there are much larger variants of the design with the lower speed likely being preferred due to the most likely area of operations mostly around Europe which meant less of a need for speed and more of an emphasis on being able to endure damage from shore based attacks and other ships as.

<p>It probably wasnt fully understood at the time but the end of the battleship era was at hand. They were never ordered due to signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922 which limited the size and armament of battleships to 35000 long tons 36000 t and no gun bigger than 16 inches 406 mm. They were never completed either. But the war came too soon and the Lion s never saw service. Sunk by aircraft incomplete 1944.
