<h3 id="most-efficient-big-reactor-designs">Most Efficient Big Reactor Designs.</h3><p>And we talk about Direwolf20 which use default 1x ratio for RF output. Any design which could consume more than that will cap at that limit and should be considered theoretical. It is arguably the most popular of the reactor-based mods and it currently in many of the packs on DeVco. They are made up of individual blocks arranged according to specific rules which together create a large functional machine. This is literally the most efficient a reactor can get.

<p>Finish the RTG for midearly-game power. Avoid any negative bends in the line better have a straight line from reactor bottom to centrifuge dont reduce the line size from reactor bottom to centrifuge is possible use a metering pump if the temperature of filtration is above RT then add hot cold insulation to the line as every one knows reduce the RPM of reactor while feeding so that you can achieve continous flow. Only decision is enderium blocks or ludicrite blocks. So far though im yet to find a stable high end power plant design i even tried splitting the system into 4 reactors 1 big RC tank in the middle piped to a large turbine output to enderIO capacitor bank around the top of the turbine.
