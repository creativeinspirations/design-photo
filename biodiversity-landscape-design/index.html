<p>A landscape management plan is a useful tool to ensure the long term success of the open spaces and developers should consider preparing a plan. It is an approach for development that leaves biodiversity in a better state for wildlife. The value of these services such as food water medicine and other resources was estimated to be 125 trillion per year in 2011. Through the history of civilization most of the attempts to increase the urban biodiversity restricted just to managing the particular green areas or conserving and restoring certain habitats inside the cities. The incorporation of native biodiversity into new and existing parks and landscape designs is an important element of an integrated holistic approach to create sustainable urban infrastructure.
