Bicycle lanes are one-way facilities and carry bicycle traffic in the same direction as adjacent motor vehicle traffic. The two most important considerations that should be made when designing a bicycle path are safety and accessibility. The location and design of paths may be influenced by a range of aspects that need to be considered and facilities that need to. Monday 5 June 2017.
