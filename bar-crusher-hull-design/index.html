We are seriously considering adding a Bar Crusher to our stable and while visiting the Sydney Boat. With 4mm plate alloy hull matched to the 3mm alloy sides these boats are built like the proverbial out house and the crew at Bar Crusher make use of alloy in the best way possible. The Bar Crusher 560C with a hull length of 56m an overall length of 61m and a beam of 225m fits into the very popular and competitive 18-foot market. 535cr Cr Models Cuddy Cabin Roundabout Series Bar Crusher Boats Aluminium Boats And Fishing Fishing Boats For Sale Aluminum Fishing Boats Fishing Boats.</p>

<p>The 560C is designed to carry a maximum engine rating of 150hp as tested with a recommended rating of at least 115hp. One of the dramatic changes to the Bar Crusher hull of old is the inclusion of a Delta Flare. The hull also includes Bar Crushers Quickflow flooded keel system to provide. Bar Crusher 575C built tough. The boat is extremely stable at rest thanks to Bar Crushers exclusive Quickflow water ballast technology. 615c Plate Aluminium Fishing Boat Bar Crusher Boats.</p>

<p>Any opinions from other BCrusher owners or otherwise would be good servicing motors Towing and 150HP Outboard Support Suggestions. This ballast chamber which is a simple yet really clever hull design sets Bar Crushers apart from most of the plate boat pack in regards to overall performance and stability. Each hull design is constructed to suit each model whether an open deck centre or rear console up to the massive 760HT hard top. Bar Crushers Peter Cleland shows Ryan Moody the new Gen 2 hull design at the Sydney Boat Show. The evolutionary Gen2 hull design combines key features including a wider negative chine running forward optimised wider chine aft and the distinctive Delta Flare.
