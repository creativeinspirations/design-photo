<p><strong>Which Type Of Tissue Is Designed To Stretch</strong>, ZILLIISTOCKPHOTOCOM Despite these recent advances the overwhelming majority of research on connective tissue still involves cells grown in culture. One type of epithelial tissue is transitional epithelium which stretches easily and lines the ureter and the urinary bladder. Most stretching exercises attempt to accomplish this goal and can be performed by almost anyone regardless of age or gender.</p>
