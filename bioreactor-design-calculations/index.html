<p>The size of fermentors ranges from 1-2 litre laboratory fementors to 500000 litre or occasionally even more fermentors of upto 12 million litres have been used. In order to design such a fixed bed reactor it is necessary to be able to predict the temperature and concentration at every point in the reactor since present design methods are based on the numerical integration of basic differential equations which can be derived from material and energy balances over a differential element of the bed. In the upper left part the parameters can be found. Q V Q SU Q BR 17 kW 88 kW 258 kW. Q BR k BR A BR ϑ BR 05 Wm 2.

<p>The performance of any bioreactor depends on many functions such as those listed below. The attributes of a bioreactor should comply with design requirements such as sterilization simple construction and measuring process control devices regulating techniques scale-up exibility in. Reactor design uses information knowledge and experience from a variety of areas-thermodynamics chemical kinetics fluid mechanics heat transfer mass transfer and economics. One design may have low reactor cost but the materials leaving the unit. In order to design such a fixed bed reactor it is necessary to be able to predict the temperature and concentration at every point in the reactor since present design methods are based on the numerical integration of basic differential equations which can be derived from material and energy balances over a differential element of the bed.
