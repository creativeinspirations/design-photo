<p>This may result in a cost savings in some cases. Particle Swarm Optimisation and Numerical Analysis. ClearCalcs does not cover this detailing however you may utilise ClearCalcs to provide the necessary loading data on the flitch beam by hovering over the Loading Diagram as shown below. Cover plates are plates added to the flanges of beams to increase the flexural capacity of the beam over some portion of the beam. Beam splices typically resist large Bending Moments and shear forces and it is typically assumed that the flange splice carries the moment forces while the web splice carries the shear Ideally the splice should be located away from the point of maximum deflection.

<p>Cover plates Let us assume 20 mm thick cover plates for the flanges and 15 mm thick plates for the web. Obviously if the cover plate is doing more than just acting together with the beam to resist some bending moment already in the beam such as directly supporting brick for example then the forces described above must be vectorally added to the forces needed to support the brick.

Obviously if the cover plate is doing more than just acting together with the beam to resist some bending moment already in the beam such as directly supporting brick for example then the forces described above must be vectorally added to the forces needed to support the brick.
