<h3 id="processing-units-cpus-and-incorporate-these-concepts-into-the-design-of-a-simple-processor">Processing units CPUs and incorporate these concepts into the design of a simple processor.</h3><p>Design of the MIPS Processor We will study the design of a simple version of MIPS that can support the following instructions. The series will cover computer architecture processor circuit design VLSI very-large-scale integration chip fabrication. Like I said above this is by no means a complete list. First we need a basic definition of what a CPU does. Stimulation will be performed using ModelSim to demonstrate the executions of the processors 11 instructions. In traditional CPU design there have been two common approaches.</p>
