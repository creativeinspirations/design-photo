<p>If your house is still in the construction phase there are several things you can do to make it resistant to quakes. Like damping these features are tuned to match and counteract the buildings frequency in the event of an earthquake. Three centimeters of levitation will only protect a house from earthquakes that dont rise higher than three centimeters. Concrete is very good at resisting damage and wood is great for building a good strong frame in this case. Each house design is individually engineered to meet local seismic code requirements and to adapt to the natural terrain utilizing one of the many foundation options available from Topsider.

<p>Factors such as proximity to fault lines ground soil nearby natural features such as hills and oceans building age and building condition all play a role in your homes vulnerability to earthquakes. 600000 private homes were fully damaged. Legitimate options for a secure hurricane-resistant building include clay and concrete roof tiles or increasingly metal roofs which are designed to withstand the pressure caused by high winds. Air Danshins shake test dealt only with side-to-side motion and most earthquakes are not limited to a two-dimensional plane. We regularly have owners of our Solid Timber homes contact us or write public reviews saying how safe they felt in their homes during the earthquakes.
