<p>A bascule bridge commonly referred to as a drawbridge is a moveable bridge with a counterweight that continuously balances a span or leaf throughout its upward swing to provide clearance for boat traffic. Although the bascule had been in use in Europe for more than five centuries it was not until the 1890s that engineers successfully developed innovative designs that produced a balanced system making large bascule bridges easy to raise and lower. Bascule bridges have sections that are referred to as a span or leaf that are capable of being moved or rotated vertically on a horizontal axle-like pin trunnion.
