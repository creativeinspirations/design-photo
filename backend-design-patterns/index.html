<p>Alters the apps behavior to extract the data from the database. Event Sourcing is an interesting design pattern where a sequence of domain events is stored as a journal and an aggregated view of the journal gives the current state of the application. It also provides an additional layer between microservices and clients. The Web BFF in the diagram above can expose a simple GET customersid REST operation that our frontend can call instead of dealing with the complexity of calling and integrating three different systems.
