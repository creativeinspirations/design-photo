<p>The H- or I-beam design will work in most applications however if youre building a high-boost application the I-beam is better. Similarly threaded rods subjected to tension could fail by rupture at the root of the threaded region and hence net area An is the root area of the threaded section Fig5. The simulation process was performed onto the modified design New Design 1 where a slope 10 is cut at the segment between the small end and the I-beam of the connecting rod.</p>
