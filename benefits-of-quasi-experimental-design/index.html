<p>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various descriptive designs. Quasi-experimental designs are commonly utilized in social research. Quasi-experimental research offers the benefit of comparison between groups.</p>
<h3 id="these-designs-are-also-used-in-education-to-test-the-effectiveness-of-a-program">These designs are also used in education to test the effectiveness of a program.</h3><p>One of the most prominent advantages of quasi-experimental studies is that they are less expensive and require relatively fewer resources than randomized controlled trials. Compare and contrast the descriptive cross-sectional repeated cross-sectional comparative and descriptive correlational designs. It may also be necessary to use quasi-experimental designs for ex-ante. Unlike a true experiment in a quasi-experimental study the choice of who gets the intervention and who doesnt is not randomized. The performance of the two groups can then be compared after data is collected to determine if there was a difference in performance of the groups after treatment. Simply de ned the independent.</p>

<p>ADVANTAGES Quasi experimental designs are more frequently used because they are more practical and feasible to conduct research. Since quasi-experimental designs do not need extensive randomization and pre-screening they cut down on both the resources and time required to carry out an experiment. Allows researchers to take advantage of real-world opportunities. The performance of the two groups can then be compared after data is collected to determine if there was a difference in performance of the groups after treatment. Quasi-experiments have lower internal validity than true experiments but they often have higher external validity as they can use real-world interventions instead of artificial laboratory settings.
