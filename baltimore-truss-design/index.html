<p>A Baltimore truss has additional bracing in the lower section of the truss to prevent buckling in the compression members and to control deflection. The diagonal braces of this design point both towards and away from the midpoint of the bridge. Draw the two side members to connect the top and bottom of the bridge.</p>
<h3 id="draw-the-internal-members">Draw the internal members.</h3><p>Additional support is provided in the form of vertical and diagonal sections which have half the length of main sections of the bridge. The Baltimore truss is a subclass of the Pratt truss. The difference between the Pratt truss bridge and the Baltimore truss bridge is the extra diagonal beams located on the lower half of the truss to help support against buckling from. Both types were also used for highway bridges. The difference is that the Baltimore has extra diagonals at the bottom of the bridge which make it more stable. How is the Baltimore truss different from the Pratt truss.</p>

<p>Two of the most used truss bridges are of the Pratt and Howe design. Both types were also used for highway bridges. A Baltimore truss has additional bracing in the lower section of the truss to prevent buckling in the compression members and to control deflection. In design theory the individual members of a simple truss are only subject to tension pulling and compression pushing forces and not bending forces.
